Asymmetric Multiplayer Tower defence on Google Maps with Government data.

This is a two player real time strategy game, leaveraging HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and other bleeding edge technologies such as WebSockets.

This is your typical tower defence game with a realistic twist!

We're using various sources of open data, mainly provided by data.gov.uk and Police data from data.police.uk

We built the game responsively and with best practices in mind, utilising the AMD pattern to manage dependencies and GIT via GitHub to manage our source control, we employed pull requests with code reviews to maintain code quality.

We organised our tasks into three categories: Todo, Doing and Done. We used a physical Kanban board with our tasks on post-it notes and an online one called Trello.
